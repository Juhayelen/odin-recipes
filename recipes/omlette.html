<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3-4 Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Serving of Kielbasa Sasuage</li>
            <li>1-2 Red/Yellow/Green Peppers</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Butter</li>
            <li>Shredded Cheese of your choosing</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep your kieblasa and peppers by chopping them up into desired sizes. Larger pieces make it harder to fold the omlette.</li>
            <li>Crack your 3-4 eggs into a bowl, try to prevent shells from entering.</li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>Before whisking, heat pan to medium-low heat and add butter.</li>
            <li>While the butter melts, whisk the eggs until homogenized and consistent.</li>
            <li>Once eggs are whisked and butter has melted, add the eggs to the pan evenly.</li>
            <li>As the edges cook, gently push them slightly inwards and tilt the pan accordingly to move uncooked egg to edges.</li>
            <li>Once about half of the bottom of the omlette has solidified, add your shredded cheese. This will help the remaining additions stick.</li>
            <li>With the top beginning to solidify, add your chopped kielbasa and peppers.</li>
            <li>Flip half of the omlette over and let it cook for 1-2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Plate and serve.</li>
        </ol>
